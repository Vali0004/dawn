# Dawn
 * A subset of dirty_patch, what Ovr was originally based on.
 * The previous name was super_patchset
## Why?
No clue to be entirely honest
## Why open source now?
Grand Theft Auto 5 is so dead when it comes to its modding scene, that I no longer have a intrest in it.
Might as well open source this as there were good parts.
